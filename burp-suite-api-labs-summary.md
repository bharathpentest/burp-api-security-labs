# Summary: Burp Suite API Security Labs

## Key Takeaways

- Modern APIs expose more attack surface than classic web apps.
- Server-side validation and hidden parameters are often misused.
- Simple characters like `&`, `%23`, `=` can break logic.
- Mass assignment and object injection are critical API risks.
- Tools like Intruder, Repeater, and Param Miner are essential for testing APIs.

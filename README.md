# Burp Suite Academy - API Security Labs

This repository contains my personal writeups, notes, and techniques learned while completing the [Burp Suite Academy](https://portswigger.net/web-security) API Security Labs using Burp Suite Professional.

My goal is to document real-world offensive techniques that I practiced hands-on, without disclosing lab answers or proprietary content.

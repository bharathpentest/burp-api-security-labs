# API Documentation Enumeration

## Goal

Understand how the API is structured using available JS files, Swagger docs, and naming patterns.

---

## Methods

- Found Swagger/OpenAPI JSON files at `/swagger.json`, `/api-docs`, etc.
- Read `/static/js/app.js` to learn endpoint URLs and parameter names
- Observed API request formats from frontend logic

---

## Payload Hints

No payloads needed â€” just observation and reverse engineering of JS logic.
